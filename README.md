# Footsies: Soccer Training

![](https://i.ibb.co/nMbL6DwM/Footsies-logo.png)

## What is Footsies?
With many an aspiring soccer enthusiast and young player out in the world, there isn't a unified app resource to train oneself in the art of soccer outside of joining a local team or hiring a professional trainer. Footsies aims to change that, bringing an easy to use, dynamic, and fun way to build your soccer skillset from scratch and grow consistently over time. Similarly to the popular tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons, Footsies gives its users a visual character sheet of their stats and the means to improve them through practice and challenges. The ideal user for this application is any new aspiring soccer player who wishes to begin establishing a good foundation for their skillset and build from there. However, future version of this application will allow for coach-to-team module customization as well as AI analytics.
